Write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
Create a script to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).
Write a program that uses conditional statements to check if a number is positive or negative.
Define a function that takes a list and returns its sum.
Create a for loop that prints numbers 1 to 10.
Use Jupyter Notebooks to document a Python project with explanations.
Implement error handling using try/except blocks.


Write a script to automate file creation and deletion in a specified directory.
Use the os module to list all files in a directory and display their sizes.
Implement a regular expression to search for email addresses in a text file.
Create a program that reads a large CSV file and processes its data.
Write a hashing script using the hashlib library to secure passwords.
Create a virtual environment, install a package, and save dependencies to requirements.txt.
Implement unit tests for a sample function using the unittest framework.
Mock a function in a unit test to simulate behavior without executing the actual code.


Filter only negative and zero in the list using list comprehension
 
numbers = [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 2, 4, 6]
Flatten the following list of lists of lists to a one dimensional list :
 
list_of_lists =[[[1, 2, 3]], [[4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9]]]
 
output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Using list comprehension create the following list of tuples:
 
[(0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
(2, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32),
(3, 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243),
(4, 1, 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024),
(5, 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125),
(6, 1, 6, 36, 216, 1296, 7776),
(7, 1, 7, 49, 343, 2401, 16807),
(8, 1, 8, 64, 512, 4096, 32768),
(9, 1, 9, 81, 729, 6561, 59049),
(10, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000)]
Flatten the following list to a new list:
 
countries = [[('Finland', 'Helsinki')], [('Sweden', 'Stockholm')], [('Norway', 'Oslo')]]
output:
[['FINLAND','FIN', 'HELSINKI'], ['SWEDEN', 'SWE', 'STOCKHOLM'], ['NORWAY', 'NOR', 'OSLO']]
Change the following list to a list of dictionaries:
 
countries = [[('Finland', 'Helsinki')], [('Sweden', 'Stockholm')], [('Norway', 'Oslo')]]
output:
[{'country': 'FINLAND', 'city': 'HELSINKI'},
{'country': 'SWEDEN', 'city': 'STOCKHOLM'},
{'country': 'NORWAY', 'city': 'OSLO'}]
Change the following list of lists to a list of concatenated strings:
 
names = [[('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh')], [('David', 'Smith')], [('Donald', 'Trump')], [('Bill', 'Gates')]]
output
['Asabeneh Yetaeyeh', 'David Smith', 'Donald Trump', 'Bill Gates']
Write a lambda function which can solve a slope or y-intercept of linear functions.
